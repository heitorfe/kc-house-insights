# King County Houses - Insight Project

# 1.0. Context

House Rocket is a fictitious company that buy and sell real estate in King County (US). Profit comes from the difference between the purchase price and the sale price. 

# 2.0. Business Problem

Increase profit through data analysis. With the database we can find out what most impacts the price of real estate and buy cheap, increase value and sell for a higher price. For that purpose it was developed:
* Dashboard in Power BI;
* Database with the recommended properties;
* Insights from validating hypotheses.

# 3.0 Business Assumptions

* Data available is from May 2014 to May 2015;
* The business model of House Rocket is buy and sell houses, not rent;
* Data meaning:
  * 'yr_renovated' = 0 means not renovated;
  * 'city' was collect via API from 'lat' and 'long'; 
  * 'grade' and 'condition are subjective variables;
* All the data is available for buying and sell;

# 4.0. Solution

I used Python and Power BI to develop the solution. With the steps below:

## 4.1. Data Collection and Description

The data was download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction/discussion/141767) and loaded in Jupyter Notebook. There were not null values. The raw data contains 21613 rows and 29 columns.
